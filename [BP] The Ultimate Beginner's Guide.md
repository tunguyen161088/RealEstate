### Real Estate Mathematics
  * Income
    * Income is the amount of money that a property brings in
    * Ex: For a rental house with rents of $1000, $25 for use of the garage. Income = $1000 + $25 = $1,025
  
  * Expenses
    * Expenses are things within your investment that cost you money
    * Ex: loan from bank is $500, maintemance is $100, garbage bill is $50. Expenses = $500 + $100 + $50 = $650
    
  * Cash flow
    * Cash flow is  the amount of money left over at the end of the month afyer all expenses are paid
    * Ex: Cash flow = $1025 - $650 = $375
    
  * Return on Investment
    * Also known as ROI is interest rate made on money each year
    * Ex: If you invest $250 and you made $250, y ou made 100% ROI
    * Formula: ROI = (V1 - V0) / V0 where V1 is the ending balance and V0 is the starting balance

### Niches and strategies
  * Property types
    * Raw land 
    * Single family houses - Note: in certain areas, the rents derived from single family rentals (SFRs) won't be enough to provide positive cash flow
    * Multifamily: duplexes, triplexes, quads...
      * Less competition than running across bidding on SFH
      * Take advantage of the economies scale, since one loan is needed to secure multile units
    * Small apartments - 5 to 50 units
    * Large aparments - large complexes across the country that often have pools, workout rooms...
    * Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) - this is like mutual fund to stock. A large number of individuals pool their funds together, forming an REIT to purchase large real estate investments.
    * Commercial - like super market, buildings... not recommended for beginners
    * Mobile homes - 
    * Tax liens - when homeowners dont pay their taxes, the gobernment may foreclose then resell the property to investors for the amount owed. It can be very cheap but be sure to do due diligence and this kind of transactions require research, knowledge and experience
    * Investing in notes - this involves the buying and selling of paper mortgages
      * When a home is purchased with a loan, a note is created explaining the terms of the contract
      * Ex: an apartment owner decides to sell his property for $1 million. He offers to carry the full note (thus allowing the new buyer to avoid the bank loan) and the new buyer will make payments of 8% per year for 30 years until paid in full
      * If the owner decides no longer wants to be involved, he may choose to the sell the mortgage to a note buyer. Note will be sold at a discount when the seller is motivated. A note buyer will then begin collecting the monthly mortgage payments and can keep the note or sell it again.
  
  * Investing strategies
    * Buy and  hold
      * Purchasing a property and renting it out for an extended period of time
      * Most important thing is how to evaluate deals. Most mistakes are buying bad deal because not understand property evaluation or underestimate expenses, making bad decisions on tenant selection and failing to properly manage assets.
      * Real estate market cycles
        * The Bottom: Prices bottom out, causing investors to start purchasing much of the excess inventory. Deals are plentiful and cashﬂow is at an all-time high.
        * The Climb: Confidence among home buyers improves, leading to more sales, decreasing inventory, and higher prices.
        * The Peak: Prices are at an all-time high, inventory is down, multiple oﬀers are common, even above asking price.
        * The Tipping Point: Prices begin to fall, compensating for the over-building and high-prices. Foreclosures begin rising, as homeowners cannot sell due to owning more than their home is worth.
        * The Decline: Prices continue to fall, foreclosures ﬂood the market. People are fearful of buying, causing even more inventory and driving prices down.
        
    * Flipping Real Estate
      * That is the practice of buying a piece of real estate at a discounted price, improving it and then selling it for a profit
      * The most popular type pf property to flip is the single family home
      * **70% rule**: An experienced house flipper will buy a home for 70% of its current value (minus any rehab costs)
      * Ex: Home A worth $100,000 if in good condition, but need $20,000 rehab. Buyer should buy it at cost of $100,000 * 70% - $20,000 = $50,000 and seek to sell it for the full $100,000 when the worked is completed.
      * One of the key aspects in flipping is speed, a house flipper will attempt to buy, rehab, and sell as quick as possible.
      * Books: The Book on estimating rehab costs, The book on Flipping houses
    * Wholesaling real estate
      * This process involves finding great real estate deals, writing a contract to acquire the deal, and selling the contract another buyer
       * Low start-up costs
