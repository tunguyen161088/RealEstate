  * Income
    * Income is the amount of money that a property brings in
    * Ex: For a rental house with rents of $1000, $25 for use of the garage. Income = $1000 + $25 = $1,025
  
  * Expenses
    * Expenses are things within your investment that cost you money
    * Ex: loan from bank is $500, maintemance is $100, garbage bill is $50. Expenses = $500 + $100 + $50 = $650
    
  * Cash flow
    * Cash flow is  the amount of money left over at the end of the month afyer all expenses are paid
    * Ex: Cash flow = $1025 - $650 = $375
    
  * Return on Investment
    * Also known as ROI is interest rate made on money each year
    * Ex: If you invest $250 and you made $250, y ou made 100% ROI

### Niches and strategies
  * Property types
    * Raw land 
    * Single family houses - Note: in certain areas, the rents derived from single family rentals (SFRs) won't be enough to provide positive cash flow
    * Multifamily: duplexes, triplexes, quads...
      * Less competition than running across bidding on SFH
      * Take advantage of the economies scale, since one loan is needed to secure multile units
    * Small apartments - 5 to 50 units
    * Large aparments - large complexes across the country that often have pools, workout rooms...
    * Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) - this is like mutual fund to stock. A large number of individuals pool their funds together, forming an REIT to purchase large real estate investments.
    * Commercial - like super market, buildings... not recommended for beginners
    * Mobile homes - 
    * Tax liens - when homeowners dont pay their taxes, the gobernment may foreclose then resell the property to investors for the amount owed. It can be very cheap but be sure to do due diligence and this kind of transactions require research, knowledge and experience
    * Investing in notes - this involves the buying and selling of paper mortgages
      * When a home is purchased with a loan, a note is created explaining the terms of the contract
      * Ex: an apartment owner decides to sell his property for $1 million. He offers to carry the full note (thus allowing the new buyer to avoid the bank loan) and the new buyer will make payments of 8% per year for 30 years until paid in full
      * If the owner decides no longer wants to be involved, he may choose to the sell the mortgage to a note buyer. Note will be sold at a discount when the seller is motivated. A note buyer will then begin collecting the monthly mortgage payments and can keep the note or sell it again.
